cloudera manager 启动的服务 的配置文件不在/etc/hadoop/conf/hdfs-site.xml， 为client服务。
而是在 /opt/cm-5.11.0/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/905-yarn-NODEMANAGER/core-site.xml

配置文件分离的好处：
1：安全，密码client不可见。
2：A service that depends on another service may deploy with customized configuration. For example, to get good HDFS read performance, Impala needs a specialized version of the HDFS client configuration, which may be harmful to a generic client. This is achieved by separating the HDFS configuration for the Impala daemons (stored in the per-process directory mentioned above) from that of the generic client (/etc/hadoop/conf).
3：简单可读 Client configuration files are much smaller and more readable. This also avoids confusing non-administrator Hadoop users with irrelevant server-side properties.


默认是新布局。

只有 cloudera mananger enterpise 才有。
When a configuration property has been set to a value different from the default, a Reset to the default value link displays.
